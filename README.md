# Amazing Trace

**A QR code based scavenger hint written in Go**

## About The Project

The Amazing Trace was developed for the [Locals Collegiate Community](https://www.otago.ac.nz/locals/index.html) as an O-week event. The goal of the game was to introduce our first year students to locations around the university. Each team was given a set of three clues for three random locations. They had to solve the clue, get to the location, and scan the poster. Some locations had challenges lead by team members. Upon completing a challenge the team would be allowed to scan the poster, and in some cases be given the opportunity to help themselves (solve the next three clues automatically) or hinder others (shuffle their clues randomly).

The project was a huge hit with great turn out. I'd really like to run this again.

## Game play

Users are given a team code, which are randomly generated when the game is launched.
